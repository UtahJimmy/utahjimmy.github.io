title: Working with asthmatics
description: Want effective data collection? Text them.

This is a quick summary of a previous research into how asthmatics would interact with a [wireless air quality system](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2018_imwut_maav/){:target="_blank"}.

Air Quality?  Like Outside?
============

Mention Air quality to people and they tacitly assume something related to the outdoors.  But a lot of what we do can impact the air quality indoors, as well.  There's the usual stuff you might expect:  cooking, cleaning, etc.  But also some things you would *not* expect:  making the bed, vacuuming, running your dryer.

As something that's mostly (hopefully!) invisible, it's easy to ignore.  Air quality, however, is higly dymanic and hyper-localized.  You don't really notice until you can detect it, and people typically haven't been able to detect it from a available, affordable, and lack of easy-to-use systems.  This was the motivation behind our project in 2017, and the subject of [some research](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2018_imwut_maav/) I presented at UbiComp 2018 in Singapore.  


The System
============
We hacked some [off-the-shelf Dylos air quality sensors](http://www.dylosproducts.com/ornodcproair.html) to add local datalogging and wireless transmission capabilities.  This, by the way, was pretty non-trivial and [received it's own write-up](https://span.ece.utah.edu/pub/EpiFi.pdf) for a sensors conference. 

We bought and modified about 20 of these senors, and arranged to deploy them in the homes of six asthmatic families.  Each family would get three sensors that they could put anywhere they liked.  We let them run for about a month to collect some baseline data, then followed up with a tablet interface so people could interactively view and annotate their data, along with a Google Home for making voice annotations.

Interviewing

The Results
=======

* Having multiple monitors lets you make comparisons
* The ability to annotate your data improves the over-all user-experience and sense of engagement
* The interactive interface w/ data annotations let people explore their data
* People used this system for a long time!  Texting was very popular!

Recommendations
========

## People want to do more than "compare two sensor streams"

Data logging systems could benefit from some more sophisticated practices


## text messages are a good way to collect data from people


## People's personal knowledge and usage patterns change over time

It would be nice to have flexible systems that could track people's experiential growth and offer new or different functionalities depending one people's skills, goals, knowledge, etc.


Reflections

Looking back on this project....

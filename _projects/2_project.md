description: Just as nice for twice the price

Psh, $300?
============
As a seemingly life-long student, the prospect of owning any kind of nice audio equipment has mostly felt like a 'someday' proposition.  Especially when audiophilia pushes prices into absurd (and comical) territories.  I've been lucky enough to have a university surplus store that occasionally sells broadcast equipment for very, very cheap, but the speakers are mostly misses.

The now-discontinued [KEF Q100's](http://www.hifi-stereo.net/151072-kef-q100.html) were what started me down this path. I really liked the old-school vibe, but their $500 MSRP -- and even semi-annual $300 sales --  were a little too rich for my blood.  Taking to the internet, I found a very avid DIY-speaker enthusiast scene with enough of kits, schematics, and diagrams to pique my engineering brain.  It seemed like a fun project, I had research that I wanted to procrastinate against, and as most of my bad ideas start: "I bet I could build something just as nice for half the price".  

Lacking any wood working tools or experience, I opted to go with [Paul Carmody Overnight Sensations](https://www.sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/diy-overnightsensations) which checked a lot of boxes for me.  It was the right size, relative simplicity, and price point.  I ended up buying the kit through  [Parts Express](https://www.parts-express.com/Overnight-Sensations-MT-Speaker-Pair-Kit-300-706), and while it was relatively cheap ($138 vs. $300), this is where things started to head south.

Yes you get the components and cabinets, but I realized all the things I was missing:  [Clamps](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-inch-bar-clamp-96214.html), a [drill](https://www.boschtools.com/us/en/boschtools-ocs/cordless-screwdrivers-ps21-2a-34758-p/), [terminal cups](https://www.parts-express.com/Round-Speaker-Terminal-2-15-16-Gold-Binding-Post-260-283), [speaker wire](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-16-Gauge-Speaker-Wire-Feet/dp/B006LW0W5Y/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=speaker+wire&qid=1618686164&sr=8-4), [bannana plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Banana-Plugs-Corrosion-Resistant-Gold-Plated/dp/B00JFC9BJU/ref=sxin_11_ac_d_pm?ac_md=3-2-QWJvdmUgJDMw-ac_d_pm&crid=32O5A609CJWNF&cv_ct_cx=banana+plugs+for+speaker+wire&dchild=1&keywords=banana+plugs+for+speaker+wire&pd_rd_i=B00JFC9BJU&pd_rd_r=f72f6f3f-f4e7-460c-973e-528136d9db5b&pd_rd_w=LqQcA&pd_rd_wg=Ot7m5&pf_rd_p=fbf6011c-6632-49e8-9631-4e76f7f44920&pf_rd_r=JG9SF8C3D59PX61RFBPD&psc=1&qid=1618686197&sprefix=banan%2Caps%2C220&sr=1-3-22d05c05-1231-4126-b7c4-3e7a9c0027d0), plus [finishing](https://imgur.com/pWiwkU7) and [veneering](https://imgur.com/jTp5d8W) supplies, just to name a few things....

Check out my [photo log](https://imgur.com/a/ynK2r) that roughly documents the process.  

It was a great project and delivered on all fronts.  In my pursuit of building a beautiful and great-sounding pair of speakers, I succeeded in making no progress on my research throughout the entire build process, and spent more than double the cost of buying the KEFs outright.

And then I ended up buying a separate [pair of speakers](https://jblpro.com/products/lsr305) for my bedroom, anyway.

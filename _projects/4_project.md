Case Design
============

## Market research

The previous year's speaker building emboldened me to spend even more money and tackle a new project.  This was probably c. 2018, when eurorack was on the upswing in terms of its mainstream popularity.  I had cracked the seal with a Bass Station ii and MS-20 mini earlier in the year and was looking to dip my toes into hte modular waters as a way of extending my functionality.  

I was shocked to see how expensive eurorack cases were.  There's a lot of analog fetishism around fit and finish in this world, especially amongst the boomer population who, having finally amassed enough wealth to indulge themselves in the gear lust of their youth, were now keen to build shrines to their fading youth, in memorium of days, past.

Once more, I figured I could build something myself.


## I'm sure I could do that

The most cost-effective solution at the time seemed to be the TipTop Mantis case.  at $300, it packed 2 104HP rows, with ample power to fill it.  However, I wasn't sure that 208HP would be enough... and I felt like building something again, so I figured I could save some money doing it on my own.  Notice a theme?

## More Woodworking

By this time I learned that the university had a maker space for wood and metal working.  seeing as a case is just some wood slapped togetehr, I figured I could cobble something together from scraps:

Not bad for an afternoon.  Though the selection of appropriately sized rack rail and spacers added to hte cost, I didn't trust myself enough to freehand things, so that added to the overall expense. (plus the rubber feet).

## Components

Sourcing rack rail is harder than it should be, and expensive.  Mouser had the best prices, but

I interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2019 and 2020, where I designed and implemented an interactive dashboard for [organizing and reviewing mission simulation data](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2021_aas_porter/).  This was a joint project with Rohan Patel, another astrodynamics intern, who helped me better understand the problem domain. Our paper was published and presented at the American Astronautical Society (AAS) in 2021.

For a shorter summary, this [slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BCUMZBKdMbK_Kq3fyL2aAnrkCDVFWsrnQJkpUI2Qz_g/edit?usp=sharing) outlines my internships' scope, goals, and  activities.  The presentation speakers notes provide some details to flesh out each slide.

This is a quick summary of an [outeach project](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2019_asee_air_quality/){:target="_blank"} to teach middle and high school students about how air quality can change within the Salt Lake Valley.

## Things students say

Walking into some of these schools was like being transported into a John Hughes movie.  I'm not terribly old, but I've forgotten how small middle schoolers are and how uncomfortably rigid school policies can be.  Tons of cringy school spirit posters everywhere with constant reminders about the behaviors pupils of "School X" do (or don't) practice. Also the wifi sucks.  Maybe I'll post some pictures if it's not a privacy violation.

Anyway, there were a number of wild quotes I overheard while conducting these modules.  
* "You actually do this for fun?" -- n incredulous highschooler not quite sold on the virtues of working with data.
* "Poor people really love their fireworks" -- Glib remarks over how 'the west side of town' disproportionately suffered the effects of poor air quality. I don't think we dove into that concept nearly as much as we could/should have.  The observation, spurious though it might be, still offers a valuable conversation starter on more sensitive topics like social and health inequalities, and hidden, long-term costs of industry.

I'll add more to this over time.

I am a PhD student in the [Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) and work with [Miriah Meyer](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/) and [Jason Wiese](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/).  My research fouses on people's workflows, and ways to make working with data more productive and engaging.  

I consider myself a hybrid qualitative researcher with a technical background, and have developed visualization tools for asthmatics, high school students, and actual rocket scientists. 

Outside of school, I am interested music, electronics, and music electronics.  I have a small synth collection and eurorack habit, with the bank statements to prove it.

Want to collaborate?  Send me an e-mail!

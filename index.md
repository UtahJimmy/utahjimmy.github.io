I am a PhD student in the [Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/) and work with [Miriah Meyer](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/) and [Jason Wiese](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/).  My research focuses on people's workflows, and ways to make working with data more productive and engaging.  

I consider myself a hybrid qualitative researcher with a quantitative background, and have developed visualization tools for [asthmatics](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2018_imwut_maav/), [high school students](https://utahjimmy.github.io/AQ-U_Explorer/), and [actual rocket scientists](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2021_aas_porter/). 

Outside of school, I am interested music, electronics, and music electronics.  I have a small synth collection and eurorack habit, with the bank statements to prove it.
